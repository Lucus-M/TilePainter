TilePainter - a web tile based drawing application.

currently hosted at lucusdm.com/lucus/tiles

Users can upload their own tiles using the add button in the top-right section.
Currently, tiles are 16x16 pixels, but support for custom tile sizes will be added 
in the future. 
Users can change the width of the brush, drawing at a larger radius. They can
scale the image up and down using the scroll wheel or the +/- keys.

Saving and loading tile maps and tilesets
Custom tile sizes
Different tool selections, including shapes and different brush types
Animated tiles
